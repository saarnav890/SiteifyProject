I'm a firm believer that knowledge is power, so I'm constantly studying and learning new things. With a background in biology, I'm well-equipped to tackle the tough issues of cancer research. My skillset in React JS and EMF has been essential in developing the tools needed to understand cancer on a deeper level. I'm also an avid hiker, reader and water polo player, which are all great ways to relax and stay sharp. This combination of my personal and professional experiences has given me the opportunity to make a real difference in the world of cancer research.","projects":[{"title":"ANEWTREEHACKSPROJECT","url":"https://github.com/saarnav890/ANEWTREEHACKSPROJECT","stars":0,"description":"Siteify Autogenerated Website ðŸš€","language":"TypeScript"},{"title":"AnotherOne","url":"https://github.com/saarnav890/AnotherOne","stars":0,"description":"Siteify Autogenerated Website ðŸš€","language":"TypeScript"},{"title":"asdf","url":"https://github.com/saarnav890/asdf","stars":0,"description":"Siteify Autogenerated Website ðŸš€","language":"TypeScript"},{"title":"asdfasdfasd","url":"https://github.com/saarnav890/asdfasdfasd","stars":0,"description":"Siteify Autogenerated Website ðŸš€","language":"TypeScript"}]}
